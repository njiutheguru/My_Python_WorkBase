    "\n",
    "1. Design the Restaurant Payment System layout\n",
    "2. Create frames that will store all of the relevant widgets for your app\n",
    "3. Include widgets and functions that you require and place them within the respective frames\n",
    "4. Include the calculator that we created in the last section. Challenge: Try to have it so the restaurant app simply calls a function that generates the calculator rather than copy and pasting the code"
